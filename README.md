# Introduction

A spring boot Rest API with JWT Access using MongoDB and an Angular frontend application.
In order to run the application, we need the following tools and frameworks:

Technology Stack
- Maven
- Spring boot 3.1+
- Mongo Database
- Spring Security

It The design is based on the latest Spring Boot MVC, Spring Security, Spring Mongo and related
libraries and frameworks. To build and run the application do

```git clone <repo>
```

From the terminal (assuming JDK is installed and set or via Sdkman):

```
mvn spring-boot:run ```

Also use any IDE which you are most comfortable and productive with. Many of the recents IDEs 
contain useful tools via their graphical user interfaces which can be used to run the application.
